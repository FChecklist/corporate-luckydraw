"""Builds the Corporate Lucky Draw public pages in the Corporate Games (housie) look.

    python -I apps/web/tools/make_site.py            (from the repo root; writes into apps/web/public)

New pages are written whole: index, how-it-works, guide, brochure, organizer-guide (a short pointer to /guide), 404, offline.
The older pages (legal text, pricing, about, contact, trust, partner, help desk) keep their text: only head, header and footer are replaced
